Core purpose:

To allow anyone to sign up and instantly become a store owner (create and manage their own online store).

To allow those store owners to invite staff/admins to help manage their store.

To allow customers to sign up and buy products across those stores.

At the system level, you (Victor) act as the platform owner (system admin), managing the whole infrastructure 
(stores, users, payments, settings).


Users can be both buyers and sellers.

Stores are isolated tenants, but run on your shared infrastructure.

Roles and permissions define what each actor can do at both system level and store level.
