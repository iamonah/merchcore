| **Catalog**              | The organized list of products that customers can browse. Usually includes categories, product descriptions, images, variants (sizes, colors), and prices. | Think of Amazon's "Electronics" page – that’s a catalog of items.            |
| **Inventory**            | The stock levels of each product variant. This ensures you don't oversell. Inventory updates when someone buys or cancels.                                 | You have 10 blue T-shirts. When someone orders 2, inventory becomes 8.       |
| **Customer**             | The person buying from your store. You may store their profile, order history, preferences.                                                                | A user account in your system.                                               |

| **Payment**              | How the customer pays for the order (credit card, PayPal, crypto). Includes status (paid, refunded, failed).                                               | Stripe/PayPal handles payment. Your backend must track if it was successful. |
| **Notification**         | How you inform users about updates (order confirmed, shipped, delivered). Could be via email, SMS, push notification.                                      | "Your order has been shipped!" email.                                        |
| **Chat / Support**       | A way for customers to talk to support or sellers. Could be real-time (WebSocket) or async (ticket-based).                                                 | WhatsApp-like chat with support.                                             |

| **Promotion / Discount** | Rules for reducing prices (coupons, sales).                                                                                                                | "10% off when you buy 3 or more".                                            |
